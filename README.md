The input data for part 1 of the script was processed from the following raw data:

# The raw pressure data files developed by Halpern et al (2015) can be accessed at: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/doi:10.5063/F1S180FS (and then need to be re-projected to match the WDPA planet data)

# The raw MPA data was downloaded from www.protectedplanet.net (July 2016 version) (and then need to be split by category, with terrestrial protected areas removed).

The methods for processing the raw data are detailed in:

Stevenson, S. L., Woolley, S. N., Barnett, J., & Dunstan, P. (2019). Testing the presence of marine protected areas against their ability to reduce pressures on biodiversity. Conservation Biology.
